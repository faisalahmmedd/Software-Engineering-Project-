# Inventary Management System


This Inventory Management System (IMS) is a software application designed to facilitate efficient tracking, management, and control of inventory within an organization. The system is developed using the Waterfall Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodology to ensure a systematic and structured approach to software development.


## Features

- ### Manage Product
  Here user can enter the name of the product, the quantity of that product is available and admin cant set the price of that single product. Admin can add the description of that product. Later on Admin can 
  update all the details of those products.

- ### Manage Order
  Here customer can enter a product name, and enter the quantity needed of that particular product and add that product into cart. After finishing the order, it will generate a pay bill slip for the customer 
  according to which the customer will pay.

# 1. Feasibility Study

  ## Purpose
  The feasibility study phase involves a thorough assessment of the proposed Inventory 
  Management System to determine its viability. This phase identifies potential challenges, 
  evaluates alternatives, and provides a basis for decision-making.

  ## Activities
  - Market Analysis: Evaluate the need for an inventory management system in the market.
  - Technical Feasibility: Assess the technological capabilities and requirements.
  - Financial Feasibility: Estimate costs, benefits, and return on investment.
  - Operational Feasibility: Analyze how well the system aligns with operational processes.

 ## Deliverable
 A Feasibility Study Report outlining the findings and recommendations.


# 2. Requirements Analysis and Specification 

 ## Purpose
 This phase focuses on understanding and documenting the functional and non-functional 
 requirements of the Inventory Management System.
 
## Activities
- Gather Requirements: Engage stakeholders to collect and document system requirements.
- Requirements Analysis: Analyze and prioritize requirements.
- Requirements Specification: Document detailed specifications, including use cases and user 
  stories.

## Deliverable
A Requirements Specification document outlining the system's functional and non-functional requirements.

# 3. Design

## Purpose
Designing the system involves creating a blueprint for the Inventory Management System based on the gathered requirements.

## Activities
- System Architecture: Define the overall system architecture.
- Database Design: Design the database schema for storing inventory and user data.
- User Interface Design: Create wireframes and prototypes for the user interface.
- Module Design: Break down the system into manageable modules.

## Deliverable
Detailed design documents including architecture diagrams, database schema, and user interface mockups.

# 4. Coding and Unit Testing

## Purpose 
The coding and unit testing phase involves actual implementation of the Inventory Management System based on the design specifications.

## Activities
- Coding: Write code for each module based on the design documents.
- Unit Testing: Test individual units or modules in isolation to ensure they function correctly.
- Code Reviews: Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards.

## Deliverable
Source code for the entire system along with documented unit test results.

# 5. Integration and System Testing

## Purpose
Integration and system testing phase focuses on ensuring that all modules work together seamlessly as a complete system.

## Activities
- Integration Testing: Verify the interaction between different modules.
- System Testing: Test the entire system against the specified requirements.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validate the system with end-users

## Deliverable
A fully integrated and tested Inventory Management System ready for deployment.

# 6. Maintenance

## Purpose
The maintenance phase involves making enhancements, fixing bugs, and providing support for the deployed system.

## Activities
- Bug Fixes: Address and resolve any issues identified post-deployment.
- Updates and Enhancements: Implement additional features or improvements based on user feedback.
- User Support: Provide ongoing support and training as needed.
  
## Deliverable
Regularly updated versions of the Inventory Management System with improved features and bug fixes.


## Review 
The system's success lies in its ability to offer a user-friendly interface, efficient inventory tracking, and robust reporting capabilities. Regular maintenance ensures continuous improvement and adaptability to evolving business needs.
